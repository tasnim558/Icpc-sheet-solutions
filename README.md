# ICPC Sheet Solutions - Codeforces 🏆
Welcome! This repository contains my 
solutions to the **ICPC Training Sheets** 
(Assiut University) on Codeforces. 
These problems cover essential topics
for building a strong foundation 
in programming and competitive problem-solving.

### 🛠️ Programming Language
I have used the **C Programming Language** 
to solve all the problems in this repository. 
My focus was on writing clean and 
efficient logic using C.
## 📂 Repository Structure
The solutions are neatly organized into 
folders based on the training sheets to 
ensure easy navigation:

* **Sheet #1 (Data type - Conditions):
* ** Basic syntax, variables, and conditional statements.
* **Sheet #2 (Loops):
* ** Implementing iterative logic using `for` and `while` loops.
* **Sheet #3 (Arrays):
* ** Data manipulation using 1D and 2D arrays.
* **Sheet #4 (Strings):
* ** Handling character arrays and string library functions.
* **Sheet #5 (Functions):
* ** Modular programming with user-defined functions.
* **Sheet #6 (Math - Geometry):
* ** Solving mathematical and geometric problems.
* **Sheet #7 (Recursion):
* ** Solving complex problems through recursive function calls.
* ## 🎯 Learning Outcome
By completing these sheets, I have improved my skills in:
* Logic building and algorithm development.
* Memory management and data structures in C.
* Handling various types of input and output scenarios.
